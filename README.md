# Protein-folding

Two versions of the protein folding code I wrote. It is a simple 2 dimensional Monte Carlo folding simulation on a quadratic grid. The force filed model uses just two types of residues, hydrophobic and hydrophilic.

The fist version was written when I was a grad student. 

The second version was written much latter. That version uses vector class. It is much slower than the bare bones version.

There are also two scripts added. The first one is the analysis code (displays the folded protein and the energy of the system). 

The second one creates staring configuration. The starting configuration(s) may be used in the analysis of the chaperone assisted folding.
